    "NB This is just what I had to do and things may have changed as it is a large collaboration with many working cogs, but I hope it can give you a starting point at least. People to get in touch with are Sam the Durham PHD student for anything k-correction related and Ashley Ross who wrote/put together much of the LSS directory. I worked closely with Sam to get `mkCat_main.py` working for the version of k-correction code he had at the time, so what's needed may be different. I have saved my version to this repository for reference."
